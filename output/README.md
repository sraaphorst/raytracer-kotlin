# The Ray Tracer Challenge Output Images

- These are the the images that are generated at the end of their respective chapters at the end of the Ray Tracer 
Challenge and converted to PNG.

- **Be aware** that you look at the following images (depicted for artistic purposes only) at your own discretion.

- In particular, the file `ch15_world2.png` depicts ray tracing of *male genitalia,* and should not
be viewed by anyone who finds such imagery offensive or upsetting. This is the rendering of an open source male genitalia WaveFront OBJ file
with:
    - 49,156 points, each with a surface normal;
    - 49,152 quadrilaterals (which are translated to 98,304 triangles); and
    - the KDTree has 196,607 nodes.
   
It was chosen particularly since it is available under the Creative Commons License, and due to its complexity to test both the ability of `SmoothTriangle`s and `KDTree`s to handle images with a large number of polygons, and to demonstrate how the use of a `KDTree` can dramatically reduce the rendering time and complexity of large triangle meshes.

- This file is deemed to not to violate the [GitHub Sexually Obscene Content](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-sexually-obscene-content) as is is not pornographic; there is no issue of consent; and there is no graphic depictions of sexual acts.
